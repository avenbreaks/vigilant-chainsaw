# Quickstart

> Before getting started, ensure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your system (version >= 1.15 and <= 1.19).
> Compatibility is being worked on for other versions and will be available in the near future.

> To install Go, run the following command in your CLI (we are using 1.18 in this example): `sudo apt-get install golang-1.18`.
> Or, use a package manager like [<ins>Snapcraft</ins>](https://snapcraft.io/go) for Linux, [<ins>Homebrew</ins>](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go) for Mac, and [<ins>Chocolatey</ins>](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/golang) for Windows.

Use the following commands to clone the Firechain repository and build from source:

  ```js
  git clone https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge.
  git checkout v1.3.0
  cd polygon-edge/
  go build -o <name_your_chain> .
  ```

## Docker image

To use Docker, you will need to have it installed on your system. If you haven't already installed Docker, you can follow the instructions on the
[<ins>official Docker website</ins>](https://www.docker.com/) for your operating system.

You can access the official Firechain Docker images hosted under the [<ins>0xPolygon registry</ins>](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xfirechain/firechain) using the following command:

  ```js
  docker pull 0xpolygon/polygon-edge:latest
  ```
