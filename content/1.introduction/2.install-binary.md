# Install binary distribution

### Prerequisites

- [Java JDK 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

note Linux open file limit

If synchronizing to Mainnet on Linux or other chains with large data requirements, increase the maximum number of open files allowed using `ulimit`. If the open files limit is not high enough, a `Too many open files` RocksDB exception occurs.


:::tip

We recommend installing [jemalloc](https://jemalloc.net/) to reduce memory usage. If using Ubuntu, you can install it with the command: `apt install libjemalloc-dev`.

:::

### Install from packaged binaries

Download the Besu [packaged binaries](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases).

Unpack the downloaded files and change into the `besu-<release>` directory.

But I recommend the 23.7.2 version for the reason that it is not too heavy

```console
wget https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/artifactory/besu-binaries/besu/23.7.2/besu-23.7.2.tar.gz
tar -xvf besu-23.7.2.tar.gz
besu/bin/besu --help
```
